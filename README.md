### 2️⃣ Experience Planner Agent

* Suggests an itinerary of attractions, dining, and entertainment aligned with user interests and trip duration.
* Includes estimated costs for activities.

### 3️⃣ Budget Optimizer Agent

* Takes accommodation and experience suggestions and adjusts to fit within the total budget.
* Highlights trade-offs between quality and cost.
* Outputs a final recommended itinerary with a cost breakdown.
